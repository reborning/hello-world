# hello-world

Welcome to the master branch! And a new journey is started!

 The first repository from the very reborning day!

Hi, There! This the readme-edits branch of hello-world repository aside from the master branch!

At this very moment, I'm an adult with a much younger soul or maybe saying too naive&childish. But from now on the awakening spirit starts to guide me to a new life, which called reborning by myself. I was too young and too naive until something from reality woke me up, things need to be done to grow up for the future. Bless me and bless the world, good luck with the journey!

Where is future guding? I don't know, but a hard try is underway.

I want to start with learning programming instead of muddling. C/C++, Java, div/css/html, php/mysql, python, and so on are on the list for a engaged life to avoid wasting time for confusion.
